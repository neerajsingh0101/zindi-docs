## Environment Settings

Environment settings is a great way to configure things which are different in Staging, QA or Production.

For example you can create environments like “Staging”, “QA” and “Production”. Then you can have different startUrl for different environments.

Certain tests should only run in certain environments. This can be achieved by mapping which environment would run test for which categories.
